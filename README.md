## Usage

A user will type the name of a city into the search bar. City names are available in an autocomplete dropdown box. For cities with the same name in multiple countries, users can find the city they are looking for by adding the country information after a comma or by selecting it from the autocomplete dropdown. E.g., Kingston, Canada vs. Kingston, Jamaica.

Upon clicking the search button, the current weather will appear, followed by a list of ten hotels in or near the city with some basic information.
